Upon entering the forest, he found a poisonous mushroom. He didn't know that it was poisonous, but hunger got the best of him, so he decided to eat it. (He lost 1 life)

He kept on walking, randomly damaging himself. Then he found a bear who he didn't know if it was friendly or not.

He kept on exploring the forest, but he heard branches crack behind him. He decided to check his left and right, and his shoulder one more time. He thought, "Maybe I'm a schizophrenic; I be fearing for my life." After checking, there was no one. Maybe he really is a schizophrenic. Then he decided to check one last time, and there was an angry bear behind him, which damaged him. (He lost 1 life)

After that, he keeps on walking. (What did you expect, bruh?) He keeps randomly damaging himself. (Which took 2 of his lives)""")
